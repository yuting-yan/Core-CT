This is an example of CT scan of massive Porites sp. coral core from the Thuwal Region of Red Sea, Saudi Arabia. The coral core was scanned using a General Electric BrightSpeed CT scanner at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology with a voxel resolution of ~0.1875 x 0.1875 x 1.25 mm (xyz). The bioerosion structure present in the core is likely to be formed by a polychaete worm.
